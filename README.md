# Advent of Code 2020

[![CI](https://github.com/zargony/advent-of-code-2020/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/zargony/advent-of-code-2020/actions)

My solutions to the [Advent of Code 2020](http://adventofcode.com/2020) puzzles, written in [Rust](http://rust-lang.org).

This time, all solutions will feature [async-await](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2020/11/07/Async-await-stable.html) using the [tokio](https://tokio.rs/) runtime.

My main goal is not to create the quickest / shortest / fastest solution ever, but to create nice, idiomatic, readable and maintainable Rust code with suitable performance.
